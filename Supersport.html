    <p>The Kawasaki Ninja ZX-10R is currently one of the most affordable litre-class supersport motorcycles in the market. It offers a potent and refined engine along with good braking hardware. Nevertheless, being track-focused, the ZX-10R isn't a very city-friendly motorcycle and is also high on maintenance.</p>

<p>The Z900 is the fast, attention seeking hooligan motorcycle. Packed with an inline four-cylinder motor, it is apt for city as well as for highway trips. The bike benefits from Kawasakiâ€™s service reach but is little expensive to maintain.
